    "# Example: SED Fitting with sedfitter (using the Richardson+ (2024) YSO models)\n",
    "`sedfitter` is a Python port of the SED fitting tool described in [Robitaille+ (2007)](). It is also the primary interface for the [Robitaille+ (2006)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006ApJS..167..256R/exportcitation) and [Robitaille (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...600A..11R/abstract) (R17) sets of radiative transfer YSO models. A [new version](https://zenodo.org/records/10522816) of the latter set was recently released alongside [Richardson+ (2024)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024ApJ...961..188R/abstract) (R24). This version expands the available information, but use of these models will likely require slight modifications to a `sedfitter`-based workflow in order to maintain functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to synthesize aspects of the [sedfitter documentation](https://sedfitter.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) into a single demonstration of the workflow and basic functionality of the tool, as well as to provide additional information on how to work with the R24 version of the 2017 YSO models. It is current as of PR #(number).\n",
    "\n",
    "(Disclaimer: No guarantees are made about the accuracy of the results, and users are responsible for ensuring that the results are reasonable and that they understand all the limitations inherent to SED fitting.)"

(The downloadable model files unzip to `r+24_models/{geometry}`.) Table 2 of R17 contains a full accounting of the names and significances of these geometries. For the purposes of this notebook, we pick `spubhmi`, which is the most populous geometry. `spubhmi` models all have disks, rotationally flattened envelopes with internal holes, and bipolar cavities."

    "Both the R17 and R24 sets of models have convolved their SEDs with the response profiles of several current or formerly active instruments often used to observe YSOs. One of the main differences between the 2017 and 2024 releases of the YSO models is in how their filters are named; the 2017 release named them solely by the filter itself, while the 2024 version incorporates [astroquery](https://astroquery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) into its convolution procedure to retrieve filter profiles from the [SVO FPS](https://svo2.cab.inta-csic.es/theory/fps/) (Rodrigo+ 2012/Rodrigo & Solano 2020). Consequently, when fitting using the 2024 models, the convolved fluxes must be invoked using the name as formatted by the SVO FPS; generally, this naming convention is `{facility}/{instrument}.{filter}`. In this data, we have access to 2MASS's J/H/K filters and the Spitzer IRAC's I1-I4.\n",
    "\n",
    "Convolution in `sedfitter` is changed in this PR to use `numpy.nansum` instead of `numpy.sum`. This prevents losing information when convolving with SEDs which have had parts removed due to S/N post-processing (see Sec. 4.2.4 of R17); previously, filters which had defined in-band SEDs would have undefined fluxes due to `nan` values elsewhere in the SED, as convolution is performed over the entire wavelength range."
